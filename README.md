# WARBL

Fork of the WARBL MIDI wind controller by Andrew Mowry (https://warbl.xyz/).

Adapted layout for 2 layers PCB and USB-C connector - Charles Grassin & [RaphaÃ«l Casimir](https://github.com/raphaelcasimir)

## Fabrication notes
You will have to cut the pins of the jack connector so they do not short with the USB-C supports.
